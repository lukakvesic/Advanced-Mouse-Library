# Advanced Mouse Library for Arduino

This library extends the functionality of the original [Mouse.h](http://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/Mouse) library by adding support for additional mouse buttons (MouseButton 4 and MouseButton 5). With this enhanced library, you can fully utilize devices with extra side buttons, allowing for a broader range of mouse inputs.

## Features

- Provides all the features of the original **Mouse.h** library.
- Adds support for MouseButton 4 and MouseButton 5 (commonly used as side buttons).
- Based on the **HID** library, so remember to include `"HID.h"` in your sketch.

## Usage

To use this library, simply include it in your Arduino project. It requires a board with USB capabilities to act as a Mouse.
